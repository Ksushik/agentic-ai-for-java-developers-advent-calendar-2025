"It's December. While others are opening chocolate calendars, we're unwrapping AI agents in Java."

## 🤖 What's This?

24 days. 24 articles. Zero fluff. This is a Java developer's practical journey into Agentic AI - from "What's an agent?" to "I just replaced my entire support team with 100 lines of code."No Python. No JavaScript. Just pure Java goodness with real, working code you can mvn install and run.

### 🎯 By Day 24, You'll Have Built:

✅ AI agents that actually think before they act (ReAct pattern)

✅ Tools that turn your methods into agent superpowers

✅ RAG systems that know your entire codebase

✅ Multi-agent systems that collaborate better than your scrum team

✅ Production-ready implementations with LangChain4j and LangGraph4j

✅ Your own MCP servers and A2A protocol implementations

Built with ☕ and 🤖 by a Java developer who believes AI should speak Java too.
